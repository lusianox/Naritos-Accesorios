# Naritos Accesorios - E-commerce Platform

## Project Overview

This project is an e-commerce platform developed for a real small business focused on women's accessories.

The main goal was to deliver a simple, functional, and user-friendly solution to showcase products and facilitate online sales, prioritizing usability and fast delivery over complex architecture.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- Netlify (deployment)

## Context & Scope

This project was developed early in my learning journey and reflects my approach at that time, focusing on delivering a working solution aligned with real business needs.

The business later closed, and as a result, the project did not continue receiving updates or maintenance.

## Reflections & Learnings

Looking back, I recognize several areas that I would approach differently today, such as:

- Clear separation between business logic and presentation
- Stronger validation and error handling
- A dedicated backend architecture (API-based approach)
- Improved scalability and maintainability

This project represents an important step in my progression as a developer and helped shape my current focus on backend development using C# and .NET.

## Current Focus

My current work is centered on backend development with C# and .NET, with an emphasis on business logic, API design, and maintainable architectures.
